Welcome to our little workshop in Structural Bioinformatics in Practice! This part of the course will  provide a practical introduction to popular tools for biomolecular visualisation, modelling and analysis.

## Main topics	
    
**1. The protein data bank (PDB)** The PDB is the main resource for structural bioinformatics with more than 120.000 protein and nucleic acid structures.

**2. Protein structure visualization** Visualization of structural data from PDB is key for insight into biological processes at molecular and atomic level of detail. 

**3. Homology modelling** Proteins with unknown three dimensional structure can often be modelled based on knowledge from similar proteins where the structure has been resolved.

**4. Protein structure analysis** Rigorous analysis of the full collection of protein structures from protein (super)families can infer important insight to protein function and mechanisms. 


## Programs used during workshop

**Day 1**

[PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do){:target="_blank"}, 
[PyMOL](http://pymol.org){:target="_blank"}, 
[SwissModel](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/){:target="_blank"}, and
[PsiPred](http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/){:target="_blank"}.


**Day 2**

[Bio3D-web](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d-web){:target="_blank"}, 
[Bio3D](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d){:target="_blank"}



## Software requirements

For **day 1** we need only [PyMOL](http://pymol.org){:target="_blank"} and a regular web-browser. Go to the PyMOL site to download [PyMOL Educational-build](http://pymol.org/edu/?q=educational/){:target="_blank"}. Fill in the form and click *Continue*. You will then recieve an e-mail with installation instructions. Install PyMOL to the default location on your computer. 

For **day 2** we need the following programs installed:

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"}, 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/){:target="_blank"},
[Muscle](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/){:target="_blank"},
[Seaview](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview){:target="_blank"}, and 
[DSSP](ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/dssp/){:target="_blank"}. 

**Side note**: Installation can be provided at day 1. 

Go to the [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/){:target="_blank"} site and click *Download R 3.3.2 for Windows*. Follow the installation instructions (use the default locations for the installation). Once the installation is complete you should see the R icon on your Desktop (and in the *Start* menu).

To install Bio3D, open R and type:

```
install.pacakges("bio3d", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Make sure the installation was successfull by typing

```
library(bio3d)
```

In addition to R, we need [Muscle](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm){:target="_blank"} for sequence alignment, [Seaview](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview){:target="_blank"} for viewing the alignment, and [DSSP](ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/dssp/){:target="_blank"} for calculating secondary structure elements of the protein structure.

Go to the [Seaview](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview){:target="_blank"} web-site and select the *MS Windows* version. Extract the archive file and move the `seaview4` folder to `C:/Program Files/`. This will install both **muscle** and **seaview**. 

Go to the [DSSP](ftp://ftp.cmbi.ru.nl/pub/software/dssp/){:target="_blank"} web-site and click on the *dssp-2.0.4-win32.exe* file. Rename the file to *dssp.exe* and move it to `C:/Program Files/`.
